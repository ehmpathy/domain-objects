wish =

use the more intuitive names as a standard

i.e.,
- `RefByUnique` instead of `DomainUniqueKeyShape`
- `RefByPrimary` instead of `DomainPrimaryKeyShape`
- `Ref` instead of `DomainReference`


- `isRefByUnique` instead of `isUniqueKeyRef`
- `isRefByPrimary` instead of `isPrimaryKeyRef`


rename both the variables and the files they're in


---

also, drop the Pivot stuff
src/reference/pivot


---

also,

getUniqueIdentifier should leverage refByUnique

also, only validate the unique keys are safe to manipulate, we dont care about _all_ keys -> thats only for serialization
