wish =

use the more intuitive names as a standard

i.e.,
- `RefByUnique` instead of `DomainUniqueKeyShape`
- `RefByPrimary` instead of `DomainPrimaryKeyShape`
- `Ref` instead of `DomainReference`


- `isRefByUnique` instead of `isUniqueKeyRef`
- `isRefByPrimary` instead of `isPrimaryKeyRef`


---

also, drop the Pivot stuff
src/reference/pivot


---

also,

refByUnique should replace getUniqueIdentifier

refByUniqueSlug should replace getUniqueIdentifierSlug

we should absorb all of the validation that getUniqueIdentifier was doing (and all the additional requirements)

except only validate the unique keys are safe to manipulate, we dont care about _all_ keys -> thats only for serialization
