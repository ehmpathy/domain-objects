wish = make the diff between @readonly vs @metadata more clear


metadata is a common type of readonly attribute

however, other readonly attributes also exist

for example

---


```ts
import { DomainEntity } from 'domain-objects';

/**
 * .what = a declarative structure which represents an AWS RDS cluster
 * .why = enables declarative control of AWS RDS clusters
 */
export interface DeclaredAwsRdsCluster {
  /**
   * .what = the cluster ARN
   * .note = is @metadata -> identity assigned by AWS
   */
  arn?: string;

  /**
   * .what = the cluster identifier
   */
  name: string;

  /**
   * .what = the cluster hostnames
   * .note = is @readonly -> resolved from AWS
   */
  host?: {
    writer: string;
    reader: string;
  };

  /**
   * .what = the database port
   * .note = is @readonly -> resolved from AWS
   */
  port?: number;

  /**
   * .what = the cluster status
   * .note = is @readonly -> resolved from AWS
   */
  status?: string;
}

export class DeclaredAwsRdsCluster
  extends DomainEntity<DeclaredAwsRdsCluster>
  implements DeclaredAwsRdsCluster
{
  public static primary = ['arn'] as const;
  public static unique = ['name'] as const;

  /**
   * .what = identity attributes assigned by the persistence layer
   * .note = describes the entity for persistence purposes, not intrinsic attributes
   */
  public static metadata = ['arn'] as const;

  /**
   * .what = intrinsic attributes resolved from AWS, not user-settable
   * .note = these are real attributes of the resource, but derived from the source of truth
   */
  public static readonly = ['host', 'port', 'status'] as const;
}
```

-----

wish = on domain objects we leave a placeholder for non-metadata readonly attributes, to show where to hang them

then, just like we have omitMetadataValues, we'd have an omitReadonlyValues

which knows that metadata is a special type of readonly

---

also, `omitMetadataValues` => `omitMetadata`

so we'd have ultimately

`omitMetadata` and `omitReadonly`


----

we want the readme to clarify this too, so that agent that use this lib know what to do


----

note that `public static readonly` is likely only relevant for DomainEntity and DomainEvent, but we can hang it directly on DomainObject generic for simplicitly and observability
