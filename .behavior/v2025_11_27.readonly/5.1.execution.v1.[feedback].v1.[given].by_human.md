# blocker.1

this part is incoherent

```ts
  /**
   * `DomainEvent.readonly` defines intrinsic domain attributes that are externally resolved and are not writable
   *
   * Unlike metadata (persistence descriptors, the most common readonly category applicable to all domain objects),
   * other readonly properties are real attributes of the event that are derived from an external source of truth.
   *
   * Note: metadata is already readonly. This property is for non-metadata readonly attributes.
   *
   * for example,
   * - a `PaymentProcessedEvent { uuid, paymentId, amount, processorResponse, processorFee }` might have
   *   `readonly = ['processorResponse', 'processorFee']` as these are resolved from the payment processor
   */
```


this is incoherent;
- readonly attributes are set by the persistance layer, but scoped to the ones that describe intrinsic attributes, since metadata captures the ones that describe persistence attributes
- metadata attributes are set by the persistance layer, sceoped to the ones that describe persistance attributes (which are metadata, because they dont describe the object itself, but only the persistance of that object)

for a domain event, processResponse would be something that is assigned before the event is persisted;

lets drop readonly from DomainEvents all together and keep them only for domain entities

seems like DomainEvents will never have readonly intrinsic attributes; only entities, since the persistance layer can update things

whereas domain events will never have updateable attributes -> everything can be known upfront


update all the docs and types to reflect this


----

# blocker.2

update the DomainObject.ts description of public static metadata to be more clear about what was documented in blocker.1 (specifically about the nature of metadata and metdata vs readonly)

make it super clear that metadata is a special subset of readonly

---

# blocker.3

update the readme and all other docs to make the above clear too


---

# blocker.4

rename omitMetadataValues.test.ts -> omitMetadata.test.ts; remove the omitMetadataValues.ts file all together;
  export the backwards compat from index.ts only
